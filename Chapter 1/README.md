# Face detection in images with OpenCV and deep learning

OpenCV’s deep learning face detector is based on the Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework with a ResNet base network (unlike other OpenCV SSDs that you may have seen which typically use MobileNet as the base network).
In this first example we’ll learn how to apply face detection with OpenCV to single input images. In the next section we’ll learn how to modify this code and apply face detection with OpenCV to videos, video streams, and webcams.
For now, run the detect_faces.py
